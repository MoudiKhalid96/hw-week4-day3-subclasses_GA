Now I am confused !!

When to use **Abstract Class** and when to use **Interface**?

In your own words guide me...
Write in **Answer** File ...

### Optional
While working on a Java project, I had written a couple of Notification Classes, and I was about to write some more, when I realized I was repeating this same pattern over and over again,

The pattern I saw repeated in my Java classes was that they all had similar method name and different implementation, something like this:

```java
 class SMSNotification
{
    public void notifyUser() { // implementation ... }
    
}

 class EmailNotification 
{
    public void notifyUser() { // implementation ... }
    
}
```
<br>

Do some code refactoring using an **Interface**  in ` src/com.ga.sub/Main.java ` and add one more Notification class.
